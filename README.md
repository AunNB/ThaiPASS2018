# ThaiPASS2018

Welcome to the Thailand-UK Python Astronomy Summer School ([ThaiPASS](https://indico.narit.or.th/event/81/page/18-home "ThaiPASS Website")) 2018

Here you will find all the information, documentation and files/data required to carry out the myriad of fun tasks and activities that will 
hopefully prepare you for the summer school.

### The Starter Pack

The starter pack should ideally be completed (read and understood with tasks attempted) prior to the start of the summer school. This is to ensure
everyone on the summer school is at the same level of knowledge and experience with coding/programming in the Python language, and to make sure
we can address any problems you may have via either email, or in person when you arrive. The starter pack contains:

- Introduction to ThaiPASS and installation instructions for the Python distribution package Anaconda
- Basic skills in Python (Introduction to basic programming in python)
- Advanced skil in Python (Higher-level concepts to programming in python with examples in Astronomy)

### First Things First - How to use Git Hub

Using Git Hub is a great tool for professionals who write programs. What makes it so great to use is that if there changes to the docts and pieces of written code, usually to fix problems or 'bugs', they can be uploaded to Git Hub and then everyone that uses the code from that repository can then update their versions quickly and simply 'at the push of a button'.

Now, we should start by downloading everything on this repository. To do this we will use the git hub desktop software: for Apple MacOS users [click here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin "Git Hub MacOS"), for Microsoft Windows OS users [click here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32 "Git Hub Windows OS"). 

Once downloaded, Windows OS users should proceed to install the software onto your machines by double-clicking on the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions; MacOS users only have to 'unzip' the file and the application can be loaded straight away by double-clicking on the unzipped file. 

When you have loaded the application, there will be a screen that will ask you if you would like to "sign-in' into a Git Hub account, you may click on "skip this step" as it is not necessary.

The next screen will ask you to input your name and e-mail address, please do fill in each of these fields and then continue onto the next page. We will detail how to "clone" a repository below. 

#### Downloading Repositories using Git Hub 

- You should now have a screen like the one below,



Once you have done this, follow the installation instructions found in the "Introduction.pdf" file in the "StarterPack" folder.
