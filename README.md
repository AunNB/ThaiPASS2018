# ThaiPASS2018

Welcome to the Thailand-UK Python Astronomy Summer School (ThaiPASS) 2018

Here you will find all the information, documentation and files/data required to carry out the myriad of fun tasks and activities that will 
hopefully prepare you for the summer school.

### The Starter Pack

The starter pack should ideally be completed (read and understood with tasks attempted) prior to the start of the summer school. This is to ensure
everyone on the summer school is at the same level of knowledge and experience with coding/programming in the Python language, and to make sure
we can address any problems you may have via either email, or in person when you arrive. The starter pack contains:

- Introduction to ThaiPASS and installation instructions for the Python distribution package Anaconda
- Basic skills in Python (Introduction to basic programming in python)
- Advanced skil in Python (Higher-level concepts to programming in python with examples in Astronomy)

### The Data

The data in order to complete the tasks can be found on this github repository webpage by [clicking here](https://github.com/Milne-Centre/ThaiPASS2018/tree/master/StarterPack/DATA_FOR_TASKS "ThaiPASS Data")...
