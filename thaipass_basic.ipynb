    "Here we will give an overview of the basic python skills needed to create simple python scripts and begin to work towards basic data analysis. These skills will prepare you for the upcoming school.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### Using a jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is a browser based python visual display. It allows for cell based coding.\n",
    "Jupyter notebook can edit most text based files, but is designed to run `.ipynb` files, such as this one.\n",
    "This can all be easliy done within the dashboard of the program.\n",
    "The code uses a kernel as its computational engine, storing memory and processing tasks.\n",
    "The kernal will store any functions, variables and previous code that has been ran.\n",
    "The kernel can be reset by going into Kernal -> Restart & Clear Outputs.\n",
    "If your code eeds to be stoped, for example if it is taking too long for a task, the kernel can be interupted by using the stop button ($\\Box$) above the work area.\n",
    "In order to run a cell with code in you simply have to shift+enter when interacting with the desired cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "### Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importing\n",
    "We begin with importing modules from the inbuilt python install. \n",
    "We can import directly form the name of the module, or call a module from within another. \n",
    "These modules can be renamed in order to reduce retyping long module names.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Commenting\n",
    "Lines that begin with a `#` are comments, these are ignored by the script and are used to take notes and explain the functionality of the code.\n",
    "Comments can also be used to cause sections of your code to be ignored when the cell is ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Print statements\n",
    "Print statements simply output a string onto the screen. Within a notebook it will output the string below the cell it is ran from.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic python function\n",
    "Simple and advanced mathematics can be performed by python. These use the standard mathematical opertors of `+`, `-`, `*`(mutiplication), `/`(division), `**`(indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code will follow standard mathematical rules, initially performing any math in parentheses, performing any indexing, any multiplication or division and finally any addition or subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values are often placed into variables. These variable will maintain the memory of any actions aligned with them, can can be called in future calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data classes/types\n",
    "The data that you will create can come in many forms. The core three types are Integer, Float and String.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer (`int` in `type()` outputs) value consists of only a whole number, with no decimal point. They can be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float (`float` in `type()` outputs) values are numbers with a decimal point in them, these are the values you will likely use most for this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings (`str` in `type()` outputs) are simply unicode characters in a list, this can be used to create words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data types can be identified by using the `type(x)` command, where x is your varaible/value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Boolean satements\n",
    "A type of class a variable can be is a boolean value (`bool` in `type()` outputs).\n",
    "Boolean values can be used to define if statement conditions, by either calling a True or False value or using \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple loops\n",
    "There are two simple looping techniques: for statements and while statements.\n",
    "For statements produce a loop based on predetermined inputs, such as 1 to 10.\n",
    "While loops will continue to loop as long as the boolean operator is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Arrays & Lists\n",
    "Arrays and lists can be used to collect data. Arrays are created using numer python and lists are inbuilt to python.\n",
    "In order to create an array the `numpy.array()` command must be used\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data structre\n",
    "Lists and arrays can be used to call specific values\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Input\n",
    "Pyhton can ask the user to input their own values, which can be stored in a variable, allowin for direct user interaction without having to open the code to alter the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "#### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important skills to familiarise yourself with is debugging your code.\n",
    "When your code does not function it will generate an error message based on the issue it ran into.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "#### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cells we will explore each topic in more depth and provide a set of examples.\n",
    "We recommend altering the cells with code in to better understand how each topic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you will find some basic tasks to test your skills with basic python. As python is an ever expanding platform many of the tasks can likely be done by external scripts, but in rder to test yourself we ask that you use only the skills shown in this notebook."

    "### Data structure, formatting and syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "Python's list structure allows for variables to be indexed, calling specific values within a list.\n",
    "For example you can call the first value in any list by indexing with 0, as python begins counting at 0. If you wanted to call the 5th value you would index by 4.\n",
    "These indexes are placed after the list (or string) as such `list1[0]`.\n",
    "By indexing with negative values you can index from within. \n",
    "Note that -0 and 0 are the same so reverse indexing begins from -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indexing method can be expanded by using slicing. \n",
    "Slicing allows for a range of indexes to be obtained.\n",
    "Slicing is performed by using a colon within a standard indexing method, for example `list1[2:5]`.\n",
    "The slicing method can be best pictured as creating an upper and lower limit based on a *slice* between the values. For example`:\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " | P | y | t | h | o | n |\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n",
    "-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tabs\n",
    "When a statement requires a constrained area the syntax of python asks only for a tabbed region, this is achieved by using the tab key or entering four spaces. This is more obvious in the if statement and loops section.\n",
    "A tabbed area denotes a section of code that is related to the statement before the tab ending with a `:`.\n",
